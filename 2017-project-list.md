# 2017 Project List

## This is a working list of school-related and non-school-related tasks already on my list for next year, structured hierarchically.

> Rather like a New Year's Resolution, this is highly idealized and subject to change. Hopefully, this will float around in a repository among repositories that will grow and become a part of my life as they become a practical necessity. With that, may this list be something I remain committed to as fully as all of the tools that made this fun experiment possible - a long-form digital mantra whose language must be practiced ad nauseum to keep the skills from gathering dust or going to rust.
